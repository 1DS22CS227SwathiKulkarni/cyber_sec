Nice — below is a focused, **exam-ready, step-by-step guide** you can follow on your **laptop (Windows or a Linux VM)** to complete **Lab Program 7 — Compare It (file comparison for forensic investigation)**. I include exact clicks/commands, quick troubleshooting, what to save for submission, and short viva answers. (This follows your uploaded lab sheet.) 

---

# Quick checklist before you start

* Decide platform you’ll use for the lab: **Windows (native)** or **Linux VM (Kali/Ubuntu)**.
* Have two sample text files ready (e.g., `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`).
* If using Windows and you want the original tool, you’ll download **Compare It** from GrigSoft. Otherwise use Linux alternatives (`meld`, `vimdiff`, `diff`, `cmp`). 

---

# Option A — Windows (use **Compare It** — closest to lab sheet)

1. Download & install:

   * Open browser → go to `http://www.grigsoft.com/wincmp3.htm`.
   * Click **Compare It Tool** download link and run installer. (Installer ~1.7 MB).
   * Follow installer prompts to install.

2. Create two text files:

   * Open Notepad → type some text → **File → Save As** → `C:\lab\file1.txt`.
   * Repeat for `file2.txt` with small differences.

3. Open Compare It:

   * Start Menu → **Compare It**.
   * App shows two panes: Left and Right.

4. Load files:

   * Click left pane **Open** → choose `file1.txt`.
   * Click right pane **Open** → choose `file2.txt`.

5. Inspect differences:

   * Files display side-by-side with colored highlights for changes.
   * Use toolbar buttons or keyboard shortcuts to jump between changes, copy differences from one file to the other, or edit inline.

6. Create/print a differences report:

   * **File → Print Preview** (or **File → Print**) to generate colored printout of differences exactly as on screen.
   * Save as PDF via “Print to PDF” if required for submission.

7. Save any merged/edited file (if you applied changes):

   * **File → Save Left/Save Right** as needed.

8. Evidence to submit:

   * `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, screenshot of Compare It showing colored diffs, exported/printed PDF of diff report.

# Option B — Linux (Kali/Ubuntu) — CLI + GUI alternatives (recommended if you use VM)

If you work in Kali/Ubuntu (VM), use these tools — they replicate Compare It functionality.

## Create two sample files

Open terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/compare_lab
cd ~/compare_lab
cat > file1.txt <<'EOF'
This is line one.
This is line two.
This line is unique to file1.
EOF

cat > file2.txt <<'EOF'
This is line one.
This is line 2.  # small edit
This line is new in file2.
EOF
```

## 1) Quick CLI diff (line-by-line)

```bash
diff file1.txt file2.txt
# For unified diff (nice for reports):
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt > diff_report.txt
```

* `diff` shows lines with `<` (file1) and `>` (file2).
* Save `diff_report.txt` for submission. 

## 2) Byte-level comparison with `cmp`

```bash
cmp -l file1.txt file2.txt > cmp_report.txt
```

* `cmp -l` prints byte offsets and differing bytes — useful for binary-level forensic evidence. 

## 3) Side-by-side colored GUI: `vimdiff`

```bash
vimdiff file1.txt file2.txt
```

* Navigation: `]c` → next change, `[c` → previous change.
* Quit both: `:qa!`
* Use screenshots for evidence.

## 4) GUI tool (closest to Compare It): **meld**

Install & run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y meld
meld file1.txt file2.txt &
```

* Meld shows side-by-side colored highlights, allows editing, copying blocks between files, and saving.
* You can **File → Save As** or **File → Print** (or print to PDF) to include a colored report with differences. 

---

# What to include in your lab submission (minimal set)

* `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` (original files).
* `diff_report.txt` (output of `diff -u`).
* `cmp_report.txt` (output of `cmp -l`, optional for byte-level).
* One or more screenshots showing side-by-side colored differences (Compare It or Meld or Vimdiff).
* Short notes: commands you ran and the tools used.

---

# Troubleshooting (common issues & fixes)

* **Compare It installer won’t run on Windows 10/11**: right-click → Run as administrator, or use compatibility mode.
* **Meld not installed / apt errors**: run `sudo apt update` then `sudo apt install -y meld`. If behind a proxy, ensure proxy settings.
* **vimdiff colors look weird**: ensure your terminal supports colors, or open in a GUI Vim (gvim) or use `meld`.
* **diff output hard to read**: use `diff -u` for unified format, or open `diff_report.txt` in an editor for printing. 

---

# Viva-friendly short answers (memorize)

* **Q: What does `diff` show?**
  A: Line-level differences; `<` = line from first file, `>` = line from second file.

* **Q: What is `cmp` used for?**
  A: Byte-level comparison; shows exact byte offsets and differing bytes — useful in forensics to detect binary tampering.

* **Q: Why use `vimdiff` or `meld` instead of plain `diff`?**
  A: They provide side-by-side colored views and let you edit/merge differences interactively (similar to Compare It).

* **Q: What evidence should be submitted for a forensic comparison?**
  A: Original files, diff output (unified format), byte-level comparison results, and screenshots of visual comparison tool with timestamps.

# Quick one-page cheat sheet (commands only — copy into terminal)

```bash
# workspace
mkdir -p ~/compare_lab && cd ~/compare_lab

# create samples
nano file1.txt   # edit & save
nano file2.txt

# line diff + save
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt > diff_report.txt

# byte-level cmp
cmp -l file1.txt file2.txt > cmp_report.txt

# visual in terminal
vimdiff file1.txt file2.txt

# GUI (Kali/Ubuntu)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y meld
meld file1.txt file2.txt &
```

---

If you want I can now:

* generate a **printable one-page PDF** (commands + checklist + viva Qs), or
* produce the two sample files plus `diff_report.txt` and `cmp_report.txt` in a zip you can download and submit.

Which would help you most for the exam?
